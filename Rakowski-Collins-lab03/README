    Pointer Practice Part 1
    a. char = 1
    b. char * = 8
    c. short = 2
    d. short * = 8
    e. int = 4
    f. int * = 8
    g. long = 8
    h. long * = 8
    i. int ** = 8
    j. int *** = 8

    Part 2
    a. 0x7fff094ff10c, 0x7fffdf1c996c, 0x7fffb10071fc
    b. 0x7fff094ff110, 0x7fffdf1c9970, 0x7fffb1007200
    c. 0x7fff094ff114, 0x7fffdf1c9974, 0x7fffb1007204
    d. 0x7fff094ff118, 0x7fffdf1c9978, 0x7fffb1007208
    e. 0x7fff094ff11c, 0x7fffdf1c997c, 0x7fffb100720c
    f. Yes, the output is different every run. The memory location  that is being used to store the values
    is being changed; Therefore, the hexadecimal value changes every time the code runs.
